# We-Rate-Dogs-Twitter-Project
The WeRateDogs Twitter gathers data from a local file, programmatically from Udacity servers and by querying the Twitter API, merges the three datasets into one dataframe, conducts visual and programmatic assessment to check its quality and tidiness, then clean it. The clean data is then used to provide worthy analyses and visualizations
